# Implementation-of-Quantum-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
University Project 

  This Notebook contains the code for our project - Implementation of Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms, implemented using Qiskit and Python. This project was implemented based on an IEEE paper(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9665779). We used three datasets:- 
  
1. Synthetic Dataset (Generated by us) 
2. Sonar Dataset (From UCI ML Repository) 
3. PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (From Kaggle) 

Quantum Computing is evolving and so are it's applications. As science and technology evolves, it is important to understand and use the advantages of Quantum Computing- the exponential speed of computations it gives over classical computers. This project is the implementation of the curiosity that my mind had - to explore Quantum Computing and implement an application to understand it better. My teammates helped me and were critical in finishing the project. We compared the observations from Classical Machine Learning and Quantum Machine Learning over the above mentioned datasets and delivered our results.
